We are Team UW for the Immerse the Bay VR-XR Hackathon! 

# Who are we? 

We are a team of UW undergrads with interests in software, VR XR, and graphics. We came to the Stanford Immerse the Bay hackathon to meet peers and professionals with similar shared interests and to learn more abut XR development.

The Team:

# Our Project

We have built a VR experience for users that desire an revolutionary experience in music. Our project - Lazer Home - allows users to enjoy lazer shows from the comfort of their own homes! The user has multiple interactable elements at their disposal to cater to their perfect visual music listening experience. 

# Technology

We used the Meta Quest 3 VR-Headset to test our technology, and Unity-3D to develop the graphics.
